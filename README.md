# Network Troubleshooting with ICMP

This repository contains documentation and steps for troubleshooting network connectivity issues using ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol). The focus of this project is to resolve connectivity problems between a Member Server and Workstation, as well as analyze routing to a Web Server and Google's DNS server.

## Overview

Network connectivity problems can often arise due to various factors, including firewall settings, routing issues, or misconfigurations. This project demonstrates the use of ICMP to diagnose and address these issues.

The troubleshooting process includes the following steps:

1. **Power On Devices:**
   - Ensure relevant devices, including Member Server, Workstation, Web Server, and Router, are powered on.

2. **Ping Testing:**
   - Use ICMP echo requests to test connectivity between Member Server and Workstation.
   - Identify potential connectivity issues based on ping results.

3. **Firewall Configuration:**
   - Reconfigure the firewall settings on the Member Server to allow proper communication.
   - Document the process of modifying firewall rules.

4. **Route Analysis:**
   - Conduct trace routes (tracert) to examine the path taken by packets to reach the Web Server and Google's DNS server.
   - Interpret the trace route results to identify routing delays or bottlenecks.


## Usage

1. Refer to [network_troubleshooting.md](network_troubleshooting.md) for step-by-step instructions on network troubleshooting using ICMP.

## Conclusion

Network troubleshooting is an essential skill for IT professionals to ensure reliable communication between devices and services. This project provides valuable insights into diagnosing and resolving connectivity issues, enhancing your understanding of network protocols and configurations.
