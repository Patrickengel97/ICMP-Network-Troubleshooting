	Device B (Workstation)
	Device C (Web Server)
	Device D (Router)
- Connect to Device B
- Open the command prompt on Device B
- Type the following command to send an ICMP echo request and ping Device A:
	- ping <IP_address_A>
		- If the ping is unsuccessful, it indicates that there is an issue with the connectivity to Device A
		- The project will guide you to reconfigure the firewall settings on Device A to resolve the issue.

- In the Firewall & network protection window, click on Allow an app through the firewall
- On the Allowed apps window, scroll down and find File and Printer Sharing
- Check the private box and click OK to allow the app through the firewall
- Close all windows and return to Device B
- Type the following command to ping Device A again:
	- ping <IP_address_A>
		- This time, the ICMP echo request should be successful, indicating that the firewall reconfiguration on Device A resolved the connectivity issue
- Type cls to clear the command prompt screen.
- Type the following command to examine the route a packet will take to reach Device C (Web Server):
	- tracert <IP_address_C>
		- The result will be a list of two entries indicating the route taken to reach the destination.
- Type the following command to initiate a trace to Google using a public DNS server (e.g., 8.8.8.8):
	- tracert -d 8.8.8.8
